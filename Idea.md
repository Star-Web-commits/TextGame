# Characters
The main two character options are going to be Soarow and Toriko. They will have different stats and stuff, going to emulate the different job classes that games have. But the thing is that they work the best together, sooooo how am I going to get this to be a 1p type game.

List of characters????
- [Soarow](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Sorawo_Kamikoshi):
    > She has a special eye that is able to see the hidden, true form of the forth kind. 

- [Toriko](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Toriko_Nishina):
    > She has a special hand that enable her to interact directly with the forth kind

Since both characters are kinda made to complement each other, I think on creating a mechanic where you can swap between the two. The thing is Soarow will have to have her power activated for Toriko to do anything so the mechanic is the best way I can achieve it. 

# Monsters
The monster are going to follow the different species of the forth kind that the characters have both encountered in the Books, Anime and Manga (Not that they are **that** dissimilar anyway)

List of Monsters??? [Monsters](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Otherside_Picnic#Novels)
- KuneKune 
- Lady Hasshaku
- Station February
    - The station has different monsters and stuff so I think I'm going to convert this encounter to be something like a bonus level with the related follow up. (Operation to Rescue the U.S. Forces)

# Game Mechanics
Since I want this game to be more of a Turn-Based RPG, I need something where it shows the two main characters so that the challenge of this is managing the characters and any status effect they might gain as well as defeating the Forth Kind. I think I'm going to make it so that the characters can get up to 2 status effects and some where they cancel each other out. 

# Game Aesthetic
I'm going to follow the with it being a text game but I think I'm going to put more visual elements than I thought. First I'm just going to tryout the game concept, and I'll go from there. this is the  [Tutorial]() I'm following to get the layout for the main program.


# A better idea of the game
Your breakdown is thorough and well-organized! Let's delve into the details a bit further:

### Core Mechanics:
1. **Character Powers Management**:
   - Creating a delicate balance between the two powers will be crucial. The player should feel the impact of their choices in using each power.
   - Resource management could add an extra layer of strategy, requiring players to think strategically about when and how to utilize their powers.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Including a variety of locations with unique challenges and mysteries will keep players engaged.
   - Introducing environmental puzzles or obstacles that require specific powers to overcome could add depth to the exploration aspect.

3. **Encounters with the Forth Kind**:
   - Implementing a dynamic encounter system where the difficulty and nature of encounters vary based on player actions and progression could enhance replay value.
   - Offering meaningful consequences for engaging with or avoiding encounters will make player choices feel impactful.

### Story and Narrative:
- Infusing the storyline with elements of mystery and suspense akin to the source material will immerse players in the game world.
- Providing branching narratives that lead to different outcomes based on player decisions will encourage replayability and offer a sense of agency.

### Game Structure:
- Ensuring a smooth introduction that effectively immerses players in the game world while gradually introducing mechanics and story elements will be crucial for player engagement.
- Designing chapters or levels with escalating challenges and revelations will maintain momentum and keep players invested in the narrative.

### Technical Aspects:
- Choosing a text-based game engine or framework that aligns with the project's scope and requirements will facilitate development.
- Prioritizing accessibility and ease of use in the interface design will enhance the player experience.

### Next Steps:
1. **Detailed Story and World Outline**: Flesh out the game world's lore, including the rules governing the supernatural elements and the protagonist's powers.
2. **Prototype Mechanics**: Develop a prototype focusing on power management, exploration, and encounter mechanics to validate their effectiveness and fun factor.
3. **Iterative Development**: Continuously gather feedback from playtesting sessions to refine mechanics, narrative elements, and overall gameplay experience.
4. **Polish and Optimization**: Prioritize optimizing the game's performance and polishing its presentation to deliver a seamless and immersive experience to players.

### Possible Challenges:
- Balancing the difficulty curve to provide a challenging yet accessible experience for players of varying skill levels.
- Ensuring consistency and coherence in the game world's lore and narrative to maintain immersion.

### Related Suggestions:
- Consider integrating player feedback mechanisms within the game to gather real-time data on player preferences and pain points.
- Explore techniques for narrative design, such as interactive storytelling and player-driven narratives, to enhance immersion and engagement.

By addressing these aspects comprehensively, you'll be well-equipped to embark on the development journey of your text-based game inspired by "Otherside Picnic"! Let me know if you need further assistance or have specific questions along the way.

# Maybe puesdocode for the game
// Define variables for protagonist's powers and resources
power1 = initialPower1Value
power2 = initialPower2Value
resource = initialResourceValue

// Game loop
while gameInProgress:
    // Display game state and options to the player
    displayGameState(power1, power2, resource)
    displayOptions()

    // Player input
    userInput = getPlayerInput()

    // Process player action
    if userInput == "usePower1":
        if resource >= power1Cost:
            // Use power 1
            power1Effect()
