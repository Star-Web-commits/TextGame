# Characters
The main two character options are going to be Soarow and Toriko. They will have different stats and stuff, going to emulate the different job classes that games have. But the thing is that they work the best together, sooooo how am I going to get this to be a 1p type game.

List of characters????
- [Soarow](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Sorawo_Kamikoshi):
    > She has a special eye that is able to see the hidden, true form of the forth kind. 

- [Toriko](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Toriko_Nishina):
    > She has a special hand that enable her to interact directly with the forth kind

Since both characters are kinda made to complement each other, I think on creating a mechanic where you can swap between the two. The thing is Soarow will have to have her power activated for Toriko to do anything so the mechanic is the best way I can achieve it. 

# Monsters
The monster are going to follow the different species of the forth kind that the characters have both encountered in the Books, Anime and Manga (Not that they are **that** dissimilar anyway)

List of Monsters??? [Monsters](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Otherside_Picnic#Novels)
- KuneKune 
- Lady Hasshaku
- Station February
    - The station has different monsters and stuff so I think I'm going to convert this encounter to be something like a bonus level with the related follow up. (Operation to Rescue the U.S. Forces)

# Game Mechanics
Since I want this game to be more of a Turn-Based RPG, I need something where it shows the two main characters so that the challenge of this is managing the characters and any status effect they might gain as well as defeating the Forth Kind. I think I'm going to make it so that the characters can get up to 2 status effects and some where they cancel each other out. 

# Game Aesthetic
I'm going to follow the with it being a text game but I think I'm going to put more visual elements than I thought. First I'm just going to tryout the game concept, and I'll go from there. this is the  [Tutorial]() I'm following to get the layout for the main program.


# A better idea of the game
Your breakdown is thorough and well-organized! Let's delve into the details a bit further:

### Core Mechanics:
1. **Character Powers Management**:
   - Creating a delicate balance between the two powers will be crucial. The player should feel the impact of their choices in using each power.
   - Resource management could add an extra layer of strategy, requiring players to think strategically about when and how to utilize their powers.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Including a variety of locations with unique challenges and mysteries will keep players engaged.
   - Introducing environmental puzzles or obstacles that require specific powers to overcome could add depth to the exploration aspect.

3. **Encounters with the Forth Kind**:
   - Implementing a dynamic encounter system where the difficulty and nature of encounters vary based on player actions and progression could enhance replay value.
   - Offering meaningful consequences for engaging with or avoiding encounters will make player choices feel impactful.

### Story and Narrative:
- Infusing the storyline with elements of mystery and suspense akin to the source material will immerse players in the game world.
- Providing branching narratives that lead to different outcomes based on player decisions will encourage replayability and offer a sense of agency.

### Game Structure:
- Ensuring a smooth introduction that effectively immerses players in the game world while gradually introducing mechanics and story elements will be crucial for player engagement.
- Designing chapters or levels with escalating challenges and revelations will maintain momentum and keep players invested in the narrative.

### Technical Aspects:
- Choosing a text-based game engine or framework that aligns with the project's scope and requirements will facilitate development.
- Prioritizing accessibility and ease of use in the interface design will enhance the player experience.

### Next Steps:
1. **Detailed Story and World Outline**: Flesh out the game world's lore, including the rules governing the supernatural elements and the protagonist's powers.
2. **Prototype Mechanics**: Develop a prototype focusing on power management, exploration, and encounter mechanics to validate their effectiveness and fun factor.
3. **Iterative Development**: Continuously gather feedback from playtesting sessions to refine mechanics, narrative elements, and overall gameplay experience.
4. **Polish and Optimization**: Prioritize optimizing the game's performance and polishing its presentation to deliver a seamless and immersive experience to players.

# Balance
To ensure players feel the impact of the balance they must maintain between the protagonist's powers, you can employ several game design techniques:

1. **Immediate Consequences**: Make the effects of using each power tangible and immediate. For example, using one power might consume resources or have a cooldown period before it can be used again, while the other power might have a detrimental effect on the protagonist's health or sanity.

2. **Scenario-specific Challenges**: Design scenarios or encounters where one power is more advantageous than the other. This forces players to consider the consequences of using each power in different situations. For instance, one power might be more effective in combat encounters, while the other might be crucial for solving puzzles or navigating environmental hazards.

3. **Resource Management**: Introduce a resource management system where the player needs to collect or conserve resources to sustain their powers. This could involve finding energy sources scattered throughout the game world or making strategic decisions about when to use powers based on resource availability.

4. **Story Impact**: Tie the protagonist's choices and the use of their powers to the game's narrative. Show how their decisions influence the story, character interactions, and the world around them. This can create a sense of agency and responsibility, as players see the consequences of their actions unfold in the narrative.

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide clear feedback to players about the consequences of their actions. This could include visual cues, such as changes in the protagonist's appearance or environment, or narrative feedback from non-player characters commenting on the player's choices.

6. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjust the game's difficulty based on how players use their powers. For example, if a player relies too heavily on one power, increase the difficulty of challenges that require the other power, forcing them to adapt and maintain balance.

7. **Strategic Choices**: Present players with meaningful choices that require them to weigh the pros and cons of using each power. These choices should have repercussions that affect gameplay, story progression, and the overall outcome of the game.

By implementing these design strategies, you can create an engaging gameplay experience where players must carefully manage the balance between the protagonist's powers, leading to meaningful choices and consequences throughout their journey.

# Maybe puesdocode for the game
    // Define variables for protagonist's powers and resources
    power1 = initialPower1Value
    power2 = initialPower2Value
    resource = initialResourceValue

    // Game loop
    while gameInProgress:
        // Display game state and options to the player
        displayGameState(power1, power2, resource)
        displayOptions()

        else if userInput == "explore":
            // Handle exploration event
            explorationEvent()
        else if userInput == "rest":
            // Restore resources
            resource += restAmount
            displayMessage("You rest and recover some resources.")
        else:
            displayMessage("Invalid input. Please try again.")

        // Check for game over conditions
        if gameOverCondition():
