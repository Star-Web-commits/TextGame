# TextGame
A project based on a game idea from yr 11, start out as text based and will slowly add visual elements.

# Language
There will be two different versions of this game it will be in different languages --> this one is python, the other one will be called TextGame-Java. 
    Maybe I'll rename this one to follow the naming pattern.
