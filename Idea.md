# Characters
The main two character options are going to be Soarow and Toriko. They will have different stats and stuff, going to emulate the different job classes that games have. But the thing is that they work the best together, sooooo how am I going to get this to be a 1p type game.

# Monsters
The monster are going to follow the different spieces of the forth kind that the characters have both encountered in the Books, Anime and Manga (Not that they are that unsimiliar anyway)
