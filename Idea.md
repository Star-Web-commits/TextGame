# Characters
The main two character options are going to be Soarow and Toriko. They will have different stats and stuff, going to emulate the different job classes that games have. But the thing is that they work the best together, sooooo how am I going to get this to be a 1p type game.

List of characters????
- [Soarow](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Sorawo_Kamikoshi):
    > She has a special eye that is able to see the hidden, true form of the forth kind. 

- [Toriko](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Toriko_Nishina):
    > She has a special hand that enable her to interact directly with the forth kind

Since both characters are kinda made to complement each other, I think on creating a mechanic where you can swap between the two. The thing is Soarow will have to have her power activated for Toriko to do anything so the mechanic is the best way I can achieve it. 

# Monsters
The monster are going to follow the different species of the forth kind that the characters have both encountered in the Books, Anime and Manga (Not that they are that dissimilar anyway)

List of Monsters??? [Monsters](https://otherside-picnic.fandom.com/wiki/Otherside_Picnic#Novels)
- KuneKune 
- Lady Hasshaku
- Station February
    - The station has different monsters and stuff so I think I'm going to convert this encounter to be something like a bonus level with the related follow up. (Operation to Rescue the U.S. Forces)
