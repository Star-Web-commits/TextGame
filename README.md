# TextGame
A project based on a game idea from yr 11, start out as text based and will slowly add visual elements.

# Language
There will be two different versions of this game it will be in different languages --> this one is python, the other one will be called TextGame-Java. Maybe I'll rename this one to follow the naming pattern.

# Game Premise
I want the game to loosely follow the Otherside Picnic story. I'm not totally sure how yet, but I will be using that as my main inspiration for the project. I want this to be something kinda like a turn base thing, so it's not fully going to follow the story.

# Characters
The main two character options are going to be Soarow and Toriko. They will have different stats and stuff, going to emulate the different job classes that games have. But the thing is that they work the best together, sooooo how am I going to get this to be a 1p type game.

# Monsters
The monster are going to follow the different spieces of the forth kind that the characters have both encountered in the Books, Anime and Manga (Not that they are that unsimiliar anyway)
